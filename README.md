## Our website 

This website is the final project of the *Data Visualization* course at EPFL. It is designed to offer an engaging and accessible analysis of a dataset containing **22,000 chess games from Lichess**. Our goal is to present insights that are interesting to players of all levels â€“ from complete beginners to advanced players.

The website is organized into four main sections:

- **Dashboard**: Offers general statistics about the dataset (e.g., game durations, number of moves, players' ratings).
- **Pieces (for beginners)**: Investigates the role and movements of different pieces across games.
- **Game Analysis**: Allows users to explore the game dynamics: openings, closings and best moves.
- **Player analysis**: Displays the interesting statistics of a player from our dataset.

Each section includes interactive and animated visualizations built with D3.js, allowing users to explore the data dynamically.
